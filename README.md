# knot-visualization
This I want to be able to do:
1. draw a knot on paper, take a picture, and have that picture be tranlated into a knot
2. have a knot be visualized and then be able to drag it around, i.e. stretch it out
3. have a knot be visualized and be able to perform a set of reidemeister moves on it
4. have a random knot and then see if it can become the unknot, i.e. a circle
5. translate gauss code into a visualized knot that we can then perform 2-4 on
