# knot-visualization
This I want to be able to do:
1. draw a knot on paper, take a picture, and have that picture be tranlated into a knot
2. have a knot be visualized and then be able to drag it around, i.e. stretch it out
3. have a knot be visualized and be able to perform a set of reidemeister moves on it
4. have a random knot and then see if it can become the unknot, i.e. a circle
5. translate gauss code into a visualized knot that we can then perform 2-4 on
6. translate conway notation into a visualized knot
7. some code on animating the knot across timesteps, this could be the trefoil tryin to unravel
itself. Obviously this will fail but it'd be fun to see it dance.
