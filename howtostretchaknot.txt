Suppose we have some knot. We then click on a part of the knot. This then colors that part of the
knot. The coloring of the knot extends in both directions by some predetermined value.
We then can stretch the knot in the plane that it is is. If we rotate while stretching this can
then create nice bends to it. If we rotate the knot such that we are interacting with two or more
points at a time we cannot stretch it, i.e. we need the points we can to manipulate to be 
well-defined in the mathematical sense. 
Another rule we should impose is that we cannot cross an existing line through a stretch.

This should be an interesting problem in terms of how the knot is representing as it is stretched.
A trefoil knot may be parametrized in x,y,z through sine and cosine. 
Do I want to be able to edit the the equation on the fly?
